## Zero-Knowledge Proofs

### What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?

Zero-knowledge proofs allow you to prove something is true without revealing the underlying information.

## Privacy FAQ

### Q: Can others see my information without my permission?
**A:** No. You must explicitly share your card for others to see any information.

### Q: What happens if I lose my phone?
**A:** Your cards are encrypted on-device. Without your passcode, they cannot be accessed.

### Q: Can Solidarity track who I share with?
**A:** No. All sharing happens peer-to-peer or via QR codes. We have no visibility into your sharing activity.

### Q: How does group verification work?
**A:** Using zero-knowledge proofs, you can prove membership without revealing your identity. The verification is cryptographic and doesn't require a central authority.

### Q: Can I delete information after sharing?
**A:** You can stop sharing information, but once someone has received your card, you cannot remotely delete it from their device. Choose your privacy level carefully.

## Troubleshooting Privacy Issues

### Missing Information

**Problem:** Received card is missing expected information

**Solution:**
- Check the privacy level used for sharing
- Ask sender to reshare with appropriate level
- Verify you're in the right group if applicable

### Unwanted Contact

**Problem:** Someone has your information you don't want them to have

**Solution:**
- Review your sharing history
- Adjust privacy levels for future sharing
- Contact the person directly to request removal
