# Architecture

Deep dive into Solidarity's technical architecture, privacy features, and implementation details.

## Overview

Solidarity is built with three core principles:

1. **Privacy First** - Your data never leaves your device
2. **Offline First** - Works without internet connection
3. **User Control** - You decide what to share and with whom

## Architecture Sections

### [Privacy & Security](/docs/architecture/privacy)
Learn how Solidarity protects your data with encryption, local storage, and granular privacy controls.

**Key Topics:**
- AES-GCM 256-bit encryption
- iOS Keychain integration
- Three-level privacy system
- Zero telemetry design

### [Peer-to-Peer Networking](/docs/architecture/p2p-networking)
Understand how Solidarity enables offline sharing through direct device connections.

**Key Topics:**
- MultipeerConnectivity framework
- Proximity-based device discovery
- QR code fallback
- Apple Wallet integration

### [Pass Signing Service](/docs/architecture/pass-signing)
Serverless credential issuance architecture for Apple Wallet integration.

**Key Topics:**
- Cloudflare Workers backend
- Privacy-preserving design
- PKCS#7 signature generation
- Zero user data storage

### [Zero-Knowledge Proofs](/docs/architecture/zero-knowledge)
Explore how Solidarity uses ZK proofs for anonymous group verification.

**Key Topics:**
- Semaphore protocol
- Mopro implementation
- Anonymous credentials
- Group membership verification

### [Technology Stack](/docs/architecture/tech-stack)
Complete technical stack, frameworks, and implementation details.

**Key Topics:**
- SwiftUI + MVVM architecture
- Native iOS frameworks
- Data flow diagrams
- Performance considerations

## Design Philosophy

### Local-First
All data stored and processed on your device. No servers, no cloud, no tracking.

### User Control
Every share requires explicit permission. You choose the privacy level each time.

### Standards-Based
Built on proven protocols and Apple's native frameworks for reliability and security.
