# Features

Solid(ar)ity combines cutting-edge privacy technology with intuitive user experience. Here's everything you can do with the app.

## Business Card Management

### Create Your Card

Build your digital business card with complete control:

- **Personal Information**: Name, title, company, email, phone
- **Social Links**: LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, personal website
- **Profile Picture**: Optional photo or avatar
- **Custom Fields**: Add any additional information you want

### Privacy Levels

Each field can have its own privacy level:

#### 🌍 Public
Visible to everyone you share with. Perfect for:
- Name
- Company
- Job title
- Public social media

#### 💼 Professional
Shared only with verified professionals in your network:
- Work email
- Direct phone line
- LinkedIn profile

#### 🔒 Personal
Reserved for close contacts and trusted connections:
- Personal email
- Mobile number
- Personal social media

**How it works:**
```swift
let card = BusinessCard(
    name: "Alice", // Public
    workEmail: "alice@company.com", // Professional
    personalEmail: "alice@personal.com", // Personal
    privacyLevel: .selective
)
```

When sharing, you choose which level to disclose. The recipient only sees information at or below the selected level.

## Sharing Methods

### Proximity Sharing (P2P)

**The killer feature.** Share cards with people nearby without internet:

- **Automatic Discovery**: Open the app, and it finds nearby users
- **One-Tap Share**: Tap a discovered peer to send your card
- **Zero Configuration**: Works instantly on WiFi or Bluetooth
- **Secure**: Encrypted end-to-end, no intermediaries

**How to use:**
- Open app and go to "Nearby" tab
- Wait for peers to appear (usually &lt;1 second)
- Tap their name to send your card
- Choose privacy level to share

**Behind the scenes:**
- Uses Apple MultipeerConnectivity
- Bluetooth LE for discovery
- WiFi Direct for fast transfers
- Encrypted with TLS

### QR Code Sharing

**Works everywhere.** Generate a scannable QR code:

- **Instant Generation**: Create QR in milliseconds
- **Customizable**: Choose what information to encode
- **Save to Photos**: Export for use in email signatures, slides, etc.
- **Works Offline**: No internet needed to scan

**How to use:**
- Go to your card details
- Tap "Share → QR Code"
- Select privacy level
- Show to others or save to Photos

**Format:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "name": "Alice",
  "company": "TechCorp",
  "email": "alice@company.com",
  "proof": "zk_proof_data_here"
}
```

### AirDrop

**Apple's magic.** Share via native iOS sharing:

- **System Integration**: Uses native Share Sheet
- **Contact Suggestions**: iOS suggests frequent contacts
- **Cross-Device**: Works with Mac, iPad, iPhone
- **Fallback**: If P2P fails, use AirDrop

### ShareLink

**Long-distance sharing.** Create a shareable deep link:

- **Send via Messages**: Text someone your card
- **Email**: Include in email signature
- **Social Media**: Share on Twitter, LinkedIn
- **Expiring Links**: Set expiration time (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week)

**Link format:**
```
solidarity://card/share?id=abc123&sig=xyz789
```

Links open the app and prompt to save the card.

## Zero-Knowledge Group Verification

### Trusted Groups

Create invite-only groups with verified membership:

- **Anonymous Membership**: Prove you're in a group without revealing identity
- **No Central Authority**: Groups managed via shared secrets
- **Cryptographic Proof**: Uses Semaphore protocol

### How It Works

- **Create Identity**: Generate a private identity (never shared)
- **Join Group**: Admin adds your identity commitment
- **Generate Proof**: Prove membership to anyone
- **Verify**: Others verify your proof without seeing identity

**Example Use Cases:**

- **Company Employees**: Verify "I work at TechCorp" without showing employee ID
- **Conference Attendees**: Prove attendance without sharing ticket info
- **Alumni Network**: Verify alma mater without revealing graduation year
- **Professional Associations**: Prove membership without sharing member number

### Creating a Group

```swift
// Admin creates group
let group = try Group.create(
    name: "TechCorp Employees",
    description: "Verified TechCorp staff"
)

// Add members (identity commitments only)
try group.addMember(commitment: aliceCommitment)
try group.addMember(commitment: bobCommitment)

// Share group ID (public, no privacy leak)
let groupId = group.id
```

### Proving Membership

```swift
// Alice generates proof
let proof = try alice.generateProof(
    groupId: groupId,
    signal: "I'm a TechCorp employee"
)

// Bob verifies proof (learns nothing about Alice)
let isValid = try verifyProof(proof, groupId: groupId)
// Result: true ✓
```

## Card Collections

### Received Cards

Organize cards you've received:

- **Search & Filter**: Find cards by name, company, tags
- **Smart Groups**: Auto-group by company, location, date met
- **Notes**: Add private notes to remember context
- **Follow-Up**: Set reminders to reconnect

### Favorites

Mark important contacts:

- **Quick Access**: Starred cards appear at top

## Privacy & Security Features
