# Getting Started

Welcome to Solid(ar)ity! This guide will help you get started with building and running the app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Xcode 15.0+** with iOS 16.0+ SDK
- **macOS 13.0+** (Ventura or later)
- **Apple Developer Account** (for device testing and distribution)

## Quick Start

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kidneyweakx/solidarity.git
cd solidarity/airmeishi
```

### Open in Xcode

```bash
open airmeishi.xcodeproj
```

All dependencies are managed via Swift Package Manager and will be automatically resolved when you open the project.

### Build and Run

Press **⌘+R** or click the "Run" button in Xcode to build and launch the app in the simulator.

## Testing P2P Features

Since Solid(ar)ity is built around peer-to-peer networking, you'll need two devices to test the proximity features:

### Option 1: Two Physical Devices

- Connect both devices to the same WiFi network
- Install the app on both devices via Xcode or TestFlight
- Open the app on both devices
- They should automatically discover each other

### Option 2: Device + Simulator

- Connect your physical device to the same network as your Mac
- Run the app on your device
- Run another instance in the iOS Simulator
- Enable network sharing in simulator settings

### Testing QR Code Sharing

The easiest way to test without multiple devices:

- Create a business card in the app
- Generate a QR code
- Save the QR code to Photos
- Use another device or QR scanner app to scan it

## Troubleshooting

### Dependencies not resolving

If Swift Package Manager fails to resolve dependencies:

- In Xcode, go to **File → Packages → Reset Package Caches**
- Clean the build folder: **⌘+Shift+K**
- Rebuild: **⌘+B**

### MultipeerConnectivity not working

Make sure you've added the required permissions to `Info.plist`:

- `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`
- `NSBonjourServices`

### Simulator networking issues

Try resetting the simulator's network settings:

```bash
xcrun simctl shutdown all
xcrun simctl erase all
```

Then restart Xcode and try again.
