# Privacy & Security

Solidarity's privacy-first architecture ensures your data stays under your control.

## Local-Only Storage

### Your Data Never Leaves Your Device

**No Cloud Servers**
- All business cards stored locally on your iPhone
- No external databases or cloud storage
- No account creation required
- Complete data ownership

**Military-Grade Encryption**
- AES-GCM 256-bit encryption for all stored data
- Encryption keys stored in iOS Keychain (hardware-backed)
- Even with device access, your data remains protected

### iOS Keychain Integration

```swift
class EncryptionService {
    func encrypt(_ data: Data) throws -> Data {
        let key = getOrCreateEncryptionKey() // Stored in Keychain
        return try AES.GCM.seal(data, using: key).combined
    }

    func decrypt(_ data: Data) throws -> Data {
        let key = getEncryptionKey()
        let sealedBox = try AES.GCM.SealedBox(combined: data)
        return try AES.GCM.open(sealedBox, using: key)
    }
}
```

**Key Management:**
- Encryption keys stored in **Keychain** (hardware-backed when available)
- Never exported or transmitted
- Unique per app installation

## Three-Level Privacy System

### Technical Implementation

Each privacy level creates a filtered version of your card with different encryption keys.

```swift
enum PrivacyLevel: String, Codable {
    case public      // Basic professional info
    case professional // Full work contact details
    case personal    // Complete information
}

struct BusinessCard: Codable {
    let id: UUID
    var name: String              // Public
    var company: String?          // Public
    var workEmail: String?        // Professional
    var workPhone: String?        // Professional
    var personalEmail: String?    // Personal
    var personalPhone: String?    // Personal
    var privacyLevel: PrivacyLevel
}
```

### Privacy Level Breakdown

#### 🌍 Public Level
**Visible to everyone**
- Name
- Company
- Job title
- Public social media

**Use cases:**
- Large networking events
- Conference badge QR codes
- Public-facing materials

#### 💼 Professional Level
**Shared with verified business contacts**
- All public information
- Work email
- Direct phone line
- LinkedIn profile
- Professional social media

**Use cases:**
- Business meetings
- Client interactions
- Professional networking

#### 🔒 Personal Level
**Only for trusted connections**
- All professional information
- Personal email
- Mobile number
- Personal social media
- Additional notes

**Use cases:**
- Close colleagues
- Personal connections
- Long-term relationships

### Selective Disclosure

When sharing, you choose which level to disclose. Recipients only see information at or below the selected level.

```swift
func shareCard(card: BusinessCard, level: PrivacyLevel) -> BusinessCard {
    var filteredCard = card

    switch level {
    case .public:
        filteredCard.workEmail = nil
        filteredCard.workPhone = nil
        filteredCard.personalEmail = nil
        filteredCard.personalPhone = nil
    case .professional:
        filteredCard.personalEmail = nil
        filteredCard.personalPhone = nil
    case .personal:
        // Share everything
        break
    }

    return filteredCard
}
```

## Zero Tracking

### No Telemetry or Analytics

**What we DON'T collect:**
- No usage analytics
- No crash reports (unless you explicitly send them)
- No behavioral tracking
- No advertising IDs

**What we DON'T use:**
- No Firebase
- No Mixpanel
- No ad networks
- No tracking SDKs
- No device fingerprinting

### No Servers, No Tracking

Since Solidarity has no servers, we literally cannot track your activity:
- Can't see who you share with
- Can't see what information you share
- Can't see when or where you use the app
- Can't build a profile of your network

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Protection

#### Device Level
- iOS Keychain for sensitive data storage
- App sandboxing prevents other apps from accessing data
- Biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID) support

#### Network Level
- All peer-to-peer connections encrypted with TLS
- Perfect forward secrecy (each session uses unique keys)
- No data transmitted to external servers

#### Application Level
- Granular privacy controls per sharing session
- Automatic data expiration options (for shared links)
- Audit trail of what was shared when

### Threat Model

**Protected Against:**
- ✅ Server breaches (no servers exist)
- ✅ Network eavesdropping (encrypted P2P)
- ✅ Identity tracking (zero-knowledge proofs)
- ✅ Unauthorized device access (local encryption)
- ✅ Data mining (no analytics)

**Not Protected Against:**
- ⚠️ Physical device access (requires device security)
- ⚠️ Malicious recipients (user must trust who they share with)
- ⚠️ Social engineering (user discretion required)

### Privacy Guarantees

1. **No Data Collection**: Zero telemetry, no analytics
2. **Local Only**: Nothing leaves device without explicit user action
3. **Encrypted at Rest**: All data protected with AES-GCM
4. **Anonymous Proofs**: ZK proofs reveal no identity information
5. **Selective Sharing**: User controls what information to disclose

## Data Retention

### Local Storage Only

**You control retention:**
- Delete cards anytime
- No cloud backup (unless you choose iCloud)
- No recovery after deletion

**Received cards:**
- Stored locally only
- You can delete anytime
- Sender cannot revoke (once shared, it's yours)

### What Happens When You Share

1. You choose privacy level
2. Filtered card data created
3. Data encrypted for transmission
4. Recipient receives and stores locally
5. **No record kept** of the transaction

## Biometric Authentication

Optional Face ID/Touch ID protection:

```swift
import LocalAuthentication

class AuthenticationService {
    func authenticateUser() async throws -> Bool {
        let context = LAContext()
        let reason = "Unlock your business cards"

        return try await context.evaluatePolicy(
            .deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics,
            localizedReason: reason
        )
    }
}
```

**Features:**
- Optional (disabled by default)
- Device hardware-backed
- No biometric data stored in app

## Audit Trail

Local-only logging of sharing activity:

```swift
struct ShareLog: Codable {
    let timestamp: Date
    let recipientName: String?
    let privacyLevel: PrivacyLevel
    let method: ShareMethod // P2P, QR, Link
}
```

**Audit features:**
- View who you've shared with
- See what privacy level was used
- Review sharing history
- **Stored locally only** - never transmitted

## Future Privacy Features

Planned for upcoming versions:

- **Advanced Selective Disclosure** (v1.2): Field-level ZK proofs
- **Revocable Credentials** (v1.3): Expire shared information
- **Privacy Zones** (v2.0): Location-based privacy rules
- **Self-Destructing Messages** (v2.0): Time-limited shares
